# Bowling in Typescript

Write a program that simulates a game of bowling.

A game of bowling has ten (10) frames.

Each frame has a score from zero to ten inclusive;

The score for the game is the sum of the scores in the ten frames.

Requirement:

  * Create a Typescript class for a Frame
  * The frame should hold a number representing the score
  * Create an array of 10 Frames representing the game
  * Use the Math library floor() and random() to generate a random number:
    Math.floor(Math.random() * 11); // gens numbers from zero to ten inclusive

At the end, print the scores for all the frames and the total game score.

IF YOU GET DONE WITH THIS

Create another class for a Game

Create the ten frames within the game

In another class, create an array of three Games

After printing the scores for each game, print the total for all three games and the average for the games.
